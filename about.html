                <p>One January day several years ago, I decided that I wanted to suprise my friends for Valentine&apos;s Day and resolved to make homemade Valentines to remind them how much they mean to me. I also decided to send along a little something extra, something handmade with care.</p>
                <p>While searching Pinterest, I came across some formulas for DIY lip balm. I compared them to the ingredient lists on the chapsticks I had in my home, and found they contained preservatives and other harmful chemicals. Concluding that I had found my project, I set out to make an all-natural lip balm with only organic, high-quality ingredients. My very first balm scents were peppermint lavender and rosemary lavender, and I sent them out to my friends.</p>
                <p>Even though my friends said they loved the lip balm, I knew it needed serious work. So I set out to make the best lip balm ever. Over the course of the next twelve months, I experimented with my recipe, adding ingredients, taking some away, changing ratios. I also explored different essential oil combinations to determine which ones smelled best. I gave a lip balm away with every batch, asking people to report back after using the product for about a month. By the following Valentine&apos;s Day, my formula had been perfected.</p>
                <p>This time when I sent out my annual gifts, I was confident that my friends were receiving a truly superb product. I continued to give lip balms away as gifts, and pretty soon I found my family, friends and friends of friends seeking to buy them. Although starting a business was never my mission, I decided to discuss it with my husband Fig and take some time to pray about it.</p> 
                <p>I began to feel the Lord telling me that this was a gift I should use for his glory. The name Pure Joy was given to me one day as I was reading the book of James and came across this passage: "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance." So I decided to start a business, with our first product being "Pure Joy . . . for your Lips!" I knew that the supplemental income would help my husband and I, who travel most of the year on a tour bus with the Christian band Bread of Stone. But I also felt in my heart that the Lord wanted more from Pure Joy. So a few weeks after I began selling my lip balms, I decided to give a percentage of our proceeds to a cause very near to my heart, Corrie&apos;s House.</p>
                <p>My dear friend Abby is in the development stage of opening "Corrie&apos;s House," a Christian home that will be dedicated to empowering victims of sex trafficking. You can read more about them below. The Lord put this calling in her heart in early 2014, and she has been following his lead ever since. Pure Joy is devoted to giving 10% of our proceeds to "Corrie&apos;s House" so that Abby and her team can become that much closer to helping these women.</p>
                <p>I hope that the products you buy from us will bring you nothing but pure joy.</p>
